# Next Steps in Developing ComicVM


## Publish & Distribute

-> as Drupal Plugin -> https://h5p.org/library-development

-> as custom element / web component

-> as npm package

-> separate dev tools from players



## Improve Usage

-> configurable backend root dir

-> configuration file format for transitions and sound

-> migrate editor features move & resize characters with mouse

-> effects like snow, rain, dust flying around, reflections etc.



## Improve Players

-> Scrollable Player (time progresses as you scroll)
  -> normalized scroller generating motion of equal tempo

-> panel swipe transitions

-> use shadow canvas for repaints

-> Improve & standardise player controls



## Sound Players

-> define panel timeline according to audio
   -> editor to define points in the audio
      - editor with audio-visual feedback:
         flicker when sound plays the defined point.
         allow the user to adjust the point in time while the audio section around the defined point is replayed in a loop



## Improve Dev Tools

-> integrated editor

-> yellow print

-> solve mismatch between background images of different layers with animation properties (warn or adjust background position)
